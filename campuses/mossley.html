intro-text: Mossley is always bustling with activities and things are always happening! Mossleyâ€™s SLT team for 2017-18 school year is, Trent Carpani, Gavin Hewitt, Erin Graham and Jen Mooney. We seek to make Mossley a fun place to come to every day and ease the boredom that school can sometimes bring. Events are frequently happening and we have fundraisers as often as possible so that we can keep investing back into our school!
