intro-text: Oxbow Campus is located right in the center of Canada! We are a small, friendly school of 15 students and 5 teachers. We enjoy competitive sports, hot lunches, holidays, field trips, and hockey. Having a small group of students, it has allowed us to get to know each other very well and make some great memories. As famous author Dr. Seuss once said, “Why fit in when you were born to stand out?” The students at Oxbow Campus definitely live by this quote!
