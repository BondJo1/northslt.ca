<p>At our campus we have 7 teachers and 46 students. Since we are a medium sized school we get to know one another very well. Abbotsford's SLT for the 2017-18 school year are Orlando Jenner, Brenna Mitchell, and Cheyenne Boram. The SLT engages the students with interactive activities such as our gourd decorating contest, our Job Fair (for the grades 10-12), our ugly toque day, and our gingerbread day. We usually do these activities as a district! Abbotsford Campus is part of the ACE district which includes Calgary and Edmonton. Below are some pictures of the activities we have done so far and we hope to do more of these events in the future! </p>
