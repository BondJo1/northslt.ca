intro-text: The Edmonton Campus has 15 students ranging from grades 3 to 12. We have 5 awesome teachers and a great secretary! The students enjoy sports, hot-lunch, and making great memories! Since we are a small school, we are very closely-knit which helps us have fun and create great moments together!
